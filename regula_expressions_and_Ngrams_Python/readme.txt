In this module we learned, among other things, about Regular expressions RegEx
which is an efficient way of searching through large text in a specific manner. 

Secoundly, about ngrams (file part2_NLTK_1906423.py) we used trigrams to give the probability
of a word given the two leading words in a corpus. Similar to what auto-complete does on e.g. a phone
where it gives suggestions of common words that relate to what you are typing.
